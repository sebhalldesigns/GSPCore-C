// GDrawing represents a generic 'drawing' that can contain
// vector graphics and text. It is indended to provide the 
// basis for rendering views and their contents in GSPCore,
// but could be generalised for other 2D drawing purposes.
//
// Initially, GDrawing aims to simply convert paths and shapes
// into sets of lines and polygons to be rendered by OpenGL,
// Metal and Vulkan. This should be a relatively trivial process
// and should be quite efficient.
